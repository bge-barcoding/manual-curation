## 🔹 1. How do I load a new dataset?

- First, download the dataset you wish to curate.
- Then, unzip it and copy the database file (`.db`) into the `data/` subfolder of the curation tool.

## 🔹 2. What do the row colors in the table mean?

- **Grey**: Pre-selected representative sequences. These can still be invalidated by the user.
- **Green**: Validated records (manually accepted).
- **Red**: Excluded or invalid records. They are hidden by default. Press **Show Invalid Records** to make them visible again.
- **White** (no color): Unselected records that can be validated if appropriate.

These visual cues help track the review and selection process.

All submitted changes are stored in a change log for documentation and review.
